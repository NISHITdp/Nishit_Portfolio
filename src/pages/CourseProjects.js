          <p className="projectOverview">
            As the <strong>Project Manager</strong>, I led a semester-long consulting initiative for Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs MedTech division, where our objective was to design a scalable and impactful AI-powered solution for e-waste management of digital health and medical devices. The project was structured to mimic a real-world consulting engagement ‚Äî from scoping and stakeholder alignment to research, strategic design, and presentation delivery.
          </p>

          <p className="projectOverview">
            Our client challenge was rooted in inefficient, largely manual recycling and refurbishment processes for devices such as surgical tools, diagnostics, and wearables. To address this, we performed in-depth <strong>technical feasibility analysis</strong>, <strong>industry benchmarking</strong>, and <strong>sustainability mapping</strong> to craft an innovation roadmap aligned with J&J‚Äôs Health for Humanity 2025 ESG goals.

          <p className="projectOverview">
            In this semester-long project, we engineered a full <strong>ML workflow</strong> to predict taxi fares using a <strong>synthetic dataset</strong> modeled on real-world ride-hailing conditions. Our goal was to develop a pricing prediction system that could simulate how Uber/Lyft determine fares‚Äîwhile enhancing transparency and planning for both users and platforms.
          </p>

          <p className="projectOverview">
            We generated a dataset of 10,000 rides using Python, incorporating <strong>time of day, weather, traffic, surge pricing, and cab type</strong>. Our pricing logic embedded real-world assumptions like base fares, distance cost, and surge multipliers. We then built a complete ML pipeline with advanced regressors such as <strong>XGBoost and Random Forest</strong>, achieving over <strong>99% R¬≤</strong> on test data.
          </p>

          <ul className="projectHighlights">
            <li><strong>Realistic Data Simulation:</strong> Created ride records with variability in surge, traffic, and cab type.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Pricing Logic:</strong> Combined base fare, distance, weather, and traffic penalty with surge multipliers.</li>
            <li><strong>EDA:</strong> Found strong correlation between Distance (r = 0.70), Surge Multiplier (r = 0.60), and Fare.</li>
            <li><strong>Modeling:</strong> Compared Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost; final model RMSE = 2.78, R¬≤ = 0.991.</li>
            <li><strong>Error Analysis & Scope:</strong> Evaluated errors, identified limitations, proposed future improvements like time-series support.</li>

          <p className="projectOverview">
            In this course project, we designed a robust relational database for <strong>ARTiFy</strong>, a digital art platform connecting artists and buyers. The database supported functionality for artwork listings, purchases, reviews, NFT tracking, and artist-customer engagement. The implementation emphasized <strong>normalization, schema design, SQL querying, and data population</strong>.
          </p>

          <p className="projectOverview">
            We finalized the system with a full ER model, relational schema, and data workflows including JSON files for NoSQL flexibility. We scripted schema generation, test data insertion, and executed analytical queries to simulate real-world admin and customer use cases.

            In this end-to-end BI project, we developed <strong>TransactIQ</strong>, a credit card analytics platform to assist executives in monitoring customer trends, spend behavior, and revenue contributions across 14,000+ users. We designed a centralized star schema data warehouse and implemented a dashboard in Power BI.
          </p>

          <p className="projectOverview">
            Data pipelines were created using <strong>SQL transformations</strong> and integrated into a <strong>multi-table model</strong> with fact and dimension tables. Our report enabled executives to answer key questions like which customers were most valuable, segmented usage by age and gender, and factors influencing profitability.

          <p className="projectOverview">
            Our team conducted a policy-focused data science project aimed at analyzing and forecasting trends in youth e-cigarette legislation across U.S. states. Using <strong>panel data from the CDC‚Äôs STATE System (1995‚Äì2024)</strong>, we studied how legislation stringency evolved and which regions were likely to face enforcement challenges or low compliance.
          </p>

          <p className="projectOverview">
            The project addressed two key research questions: (1) How does e-cigarette policy stringency change over time across different states? and (2) Which areas are at higher risk of policy violation or low enforcement compliance? We applied <strong>panel regression models, ARIMA forecasting, and classification algorithms</strong> like logistic regression and random forest to derive actionable public health insights.
          </p>

          <ul className="projectHighlights">
            <li><strong>Data Engineering:</strong> Cleaned and structured multi-decade CDC dataset; mapped variables like ProvisionValue, Enacted_Date, and GeoLocation.</li>
            <li><strong>Policy Stringency Modeling:</strong> Created a custom stringency score using weighted attributes of legal provisions; applied Generalized Least Squares (GLS) for panel data and ARIMA for time-series trend prediction.</li>
            <li><strong>Compliance Risk Prediction:</strong> Built classifiers to estimate the probability of low compliance or high violation using demographic and legislative features.</li>
            <li><strong>Modeling Justification:</strong> Chose GLS for fixed effects handling, ARIMA for forecasting, and Random Forest for capturing nonlinear patterns in risk modeling.</li>
            <li><strong>Presentation & Communication:</strong> Compiled insights into an actionable proposal for public health policymakers, highlighting high-risk areas and future legislation trends.</li>

          </p>

          <p className="projectOverview">
            The study analyzed issues such as <strong>accessibility barriers, algorithmic bias, poor UI/UX decisions, and lack of trust</strong> in digital channels. We interviewed users, reviewed compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG), and assessed interface designs based on established human-computer interaction (HCI) principles.
